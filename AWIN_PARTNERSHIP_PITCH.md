## 🎯 Target Categories for [Shop Name]

We're initially focusing on:

1. **[Category 1]** — High intent, comparison shopping behavior
2. **[Category 2]** — Choice overload problem
3. **[Category 3]** — Trust issues (many fake reviews)

**Example:** If [Shop Name] specializes in tires:
- Target: 225/45 R17 Summer Tires (52 options → 3 recommendations)
- Pain point: Users don't know difference between Michelin, Continental, Hankook
- Solution: OPTIMARKET analyzes EU labels, reviews, pricing → clear choice

2. ❌ **No hidden bias** — Transparent methodology
3. ✅ **Citations** — All claims sourced from real reviews
4. ✅ **Value score formula** — Open and reproducible

### Why This Matters:
Users trust OPTIMARKET **because** we're not incentivized to recommend expensive products. This leads to:
- Higher conversion rates
- Better customer satisfaction
- More repeat visits
